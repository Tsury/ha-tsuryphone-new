# TsuryPhone Home Assistant Integration (New) ‚Äì Design & Progress Tracker

> Status: INITIAL DRAFT (v0.1)
> Target Minimum HA Core: **2025.9.0**
> Domain: `tsuryphone`

---
## 0. Purpose
A clean, modern Home Assistant (HA) integration for the TsuryPhone device, replacing all legacy projects. This document is the authoritative source for:
- Functional & non-functional requirements
- Architecture & data contracts
- Implementation phases & progress tracking (checkboxes)
- Risks, decisions, change log
- Test strategy & validation gates

It will be iteratively updated as implementation proceeds. Progress sections use ‚úÖ (done), ‚è≥ (in progress), ‚≠ï (pending), ‚ùó (blocked), üîÑ (revisit), üí§ (deferred), üöß (scoped but not started).

---
## 1. High-Level Goals
| Goal | Description | Success Metric |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| G1 | Fully featured HA integration using latest APIs | All required entities/services functional |
| G2 | Real-time state via WebSocket + fallback polling | <2s lag typical, seamless reconnect |
| G3 | Full event emission for automations | All categories mapped & documented |
| G4 | Hybrid list management (quick dial / blocked) | Lists editable via Options + services |
| G5 | Webhook action dual provisioning (manual / HA-managed) | Both workflows succeed & sync to device |
| G6 | Robust reboot & seq handling | No stale state after device restart |
| G7 | Local real-time call duration | 1s updates until call end |
| G8 | Rich diagnostics & developer observability | Diagnostics export + internal counters |
| G9 | Test coverage for core paths | ‚â• 85% lines for logic modules |
| G10 | Clean uninstall & persistence | No orphaned device config; state restored on restart |

---
## 2. Scope Overview
### In Scope
- Zeroconf discovery (mDNS / http service, TXT `device=tsuryphone`)
- Config Flow + Options Flow (all configuration categories)
- Entities (core phone, stats, audio, mode, pattern select, quick dial select, call status, etc.)
- Services (¬ß8)
- Device triggers & conditions
- Event bus propagation of all device events (separate event types)
- Sequence enforcement & reboot detection
- Webhook action management (manual + HA-created)
- Real-time call duration ticker (local)
- Persistent cache (restore state on HA reboot)
- Diagnostics output
- Import/export for quick dials & block list

### Out of Scope (Initial)
- TLS / HTTPS to device
- Authentication / tokens
- Gzip compression
- Large-scale phonebook sync
- Webhook invocation acknowledgment events (device does not emit yet)

### Deferred / Future Hooks
- Security hardening (auth layer)
- Per-webhook HA triggers on invocation confirmations
- Multi-protocol bridging (Android integration reuse)

## 4. Data Contracts (Inbound Events)
Reference: Device JSON schemaVersion=2.

### 4.1 Root Event Fields
```
schemaVersion: int (const 2)
seq: int (monotonic per boot)
ts: int (device ms epoch / uptime? ‚Äì treat as monotonically increasing per boot)
integration: "ha" (device configured) or other
category: string (call | phone_state | system | config | diagnostic)
event: subtype string
```

### 4.2 Event Subtypes & Handling Table
| Category | Event | Payload Extras | HA Event Name | Notes |
|----------|-------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| call | start | number, isIncoming, callStartTs | tsuryphone_call_start | Start duration timer |
| call | end | number, isIncoming, callStartTs, durationMs? | tsuryphone_call_end | Stop timer; fallback local duration |
| call | blocked | number, isIncoming=true | tsuryphone_call_blocked | Increment blocked count |
| phone_state | state | state,int previousState,int ... | tsuryphone_phone_state_state | Update app + derived |
| phone_state | dialing | currentDialingNumber | tsuryphone_phone_state_dialing | Update dialing sensor |
| phone_state | ring | isRinging | tsuryphone_phone_state_ring | Ringing binary sensor |
| phone_state | dnd | dndActive | tsuryphone_phone_state_dnd | DND toggle |
| phone_state | call_info | currentCallNumber,... | tsuryphone_phone_state_call_info | Supplementary call snapshot |

---
## 5. Internal State Machine
- `seq_last`: highest accepted seq
- `reboot_detected`: bool when seq regression or reset pattern
- `call_active`: derived from app_state == InCall OR active callStartTs present
- Timer task only spawns if call_active transitions false->true and not already running

---
## 6. Ring Pattern Presets
```
DEFAULT (device native)
pulse_short = "300,300x2"
classic = "500,500"
long_gap = "800,400"
triple = "300,300,300"
stagger = "500,250,500"
alarm = "200,200x5"
slow = "1000"
burst = "150,150x3"
custom = <user provided pattern>
```

---
## 7. Entity Model Mapping
(States/attributes summary)

### 7.1 Binary Sensors
| Name | Attrs | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| ringing | none | ring events |
| dnd | none | dnd events / state field |
| maintenance_mode | none | phone_state state + config updates |
| in_call | callStartTs + state logic | state events |
| call_waiting_available | heuristic (presence callWaitingId in future) | TODO logic |

### 7.2 Sensors
- App state (`stateName`)
- Current call number
- Current dialing number
- Real-time call duration (sec)
- Last call number/type
- Uptime (seconds)
- RSSI (dBm)
- Free heap (bytes)
- Calls total/in/out/blocked/talkTimeSeconds
- quick_dial_count (len)
- blocked_count
- last_blocked_number

### 7.3 Switches
- force DND (maps to DND config `force`)
- maintenance_mode

### 7.4 Numbers
- Audio: earpieceVolume, earpieceGain, speakerVolume, speakerGain (1‚Äì7)

### 7.5 Selects
- ring_pattern (preset or custom sentinel)
- quick_dial (options = code or name with code fallback)

### 7.6 Buttons
(See R16 + dial_quick_dial via selected option)

## 8. Services (Detailed Spec)
| Service | Params | Action | Error Modes |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| dial | number | POST /api/call/dial | invalid number, phone not ready |
| answer | ‚Äî | POST /api/call/answer | no incoming call |
| hangup | ‚Äî | POST /api/call/hangup | no active call |
| ring | pattern? | pattern optional (empty=default) | invalid pattern |
| switch_call_waiting | ‚Äî | toggle | not available |
| set_dnd | force?, scheduled?, start_hour?, start_minute?, end_hour?, end_minute? | partial update | invalid range |
| set_audio | any subset of 4 fields | partial update | validation range errors |
| set_ring_pattern | pattern | update ring pattern | invalid pattern |
| quick_dial_add | code, number, name? | add | conflict/invalid |
| quick_dial_remove | code | remove | not found |
| quick_dial_import | list(json) | batch add | partial failures aggregated |
| quick_dial_export | ‚Äî | return list | ‚Äî |
| blocked_add | number, reason? | add | duplicate |
| blocked_remove | number | remove | not found |
| blocked_import | list(json) | batch | partial failures |
| blocked_export | ‚Äî | list | ‚Äî |
| webhook_add | code, id?, action_name?, auto_create? | add (with optional HA webhook creation) | conflict |
| webhook_remove | code | remove | not found |
| set_ha_url | url | update HA URL | invalid URL |
| refetch_all | ‚Äî | device reload + stats | device error |
| refresh_snapshot | ‚Äî | ask device to broadcast snapshot | device error |
| diagnostic_snapshot | ‚Äî | synth local snapshot event | ‚Äî |
| dial_quick_dial | code | direct mapping | not found |
| dial_selected_quick_dial | ‚Äî | uses selected option | not selected |

| call_history_export | mask_numbers? (bool, default false) | Return structured list | ‚Äî |
| call_history_clear | older_than_days? keep_last? | Prune history | ‚Äî |

Return payloads follow unified success/error contracting to align with device responses.

---
## 9. Options Flow Structure
Sections & forms with grouping; dynamic sub-form for lists with add/remove per entry (non-paginated). Quick dial & blocked lists bulk import/export JSON text area.

---
## 10. Persistent Cache
Fields persisted: app_state, ringing, dnd, maintenance, last call, active call (if any), callStartTs (note: will NOT resume timer; call duration sensor resets on HA reboot), stats, config lists, ring pattern, selected quick dial, audio config.

On reload: mark attribute `restored: true` until first live event.

---
## 11. Reboot & Snapshot Logic
Algorithm:
1. On event with seq < last_seq OR seq small after large prior ‚Üí `reboot_detected=true`.
2. Cancel call duration timer.
3. Force `refetch_all` (rate-limited: not more than once per 10s).
4. Clear transient dialing number.

---
### 11.1 Call History Model
Rolling buffer (fixed max 500 entries for v1; future option if needed). Entry schema (newest-first ordering on export):
```
{
	"ts_device": int,
	"received_ts": float,
	"seq": int,
	"type": "incoming"|"outgoing"|"blocked"|"missed",
	"number": string,
	"duration_s": int|null,
	"is_incoming": bool,
	"reason": string|null
}
```
Derivation rules:
1. call.start ‚Üí provisional incoming/outgoing record (no duration yet).
2. call.end ‚Üí finalize matching provisional (fill duration_s using device durationMs/1000 fallback local).
3. call.blocked ‚Üí immediate finalized blocked record.
4. missed ‚Üí any incoming ringing sequence that returns to Idle without an InCall transition (no minimum ring duration filter).
Pruning: drop oldest on overflow (log every 100 drops). Exposure: size sensor, diagnostics (<=200 recent + total), export service. Clear service supports conditional pruning.

### 11.2 Logbook Integration
On finalize push human-readable entry (Incoming/Outgoing/Blocked/Missed). Duration formatted hh:mm:ss if available.

### 11.3 Future: Interactive Keypad Streaming (Placeholder)
Proposed device commands (not yet implemented device-side):
| Command | Payload | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| dial_digit | {"digit":"0-9"} | Append digit; server returns classification & buffer |
| dial_backspace | {} | Remove last digit |
| dial_clear | {} | Clear buffer |
| dial_commit | {} | Commit call (maps to existing dial) |
| dial_predict | {} | Return classification without mutation (optional) |
Response suggestion:
```
{
	"schemaVersion":2,
	"success":true,
	"data":{
		 "buffer":"123",
		 "isComplete":false,
		 "isValid":true,
		 "classification":"partial",  // quick_dial|direct|webhook|partial|invalid
		 "targetNumber":"..."         // if resolvable
	}
}
```
HA will later expose a keypad card using websocket for low latency; fallback HTTP. Requirements R56/R57 remain üí§ until firmware support.

---
### 11.4 Clarified Behavioral Decisions
| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| Missed call rule | Any ring without InCall ‚Üí missed (no duration threshold) |
| History export order | Newest first |
| History clear precedence | Apply older_than filter then enforce keep_last cap |
| Webhook stale detection | Performed at startup and on Options open |
| Quick dial option label | "Name (code)" if name present else code |
| Ring pattern custom sentinel | Selecting custom retains previous pattern until user submits new one |
| Reboot detection | Any seq decrease triggers reboot workflow |
| Missed call HA event name | tsuryphone_call_missed |
| Event history buffer | Includes all event types (config_delta included) |
| Diagnostics history slice | 200 most recent entries (with total count) |
| Initial debug window | 300s before auto-downgrade unless verbose option set |
| Webhook auto-create naming | "TsuryPhone <code> Action" |
| Call waiting availability | Assume future firmware will expose; heuristic interim; tracked as R61 |
| Call history size configurability | Fixed 500 (v1) |

---
## 25. Firmware Debt / External Dependencies
| Item | Description | Impact if Missing | Status |
|------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Call waiting flag exposure | Device to surface callWaitingId / availability in phone_state events | Sensor may be heuristic only | Pending (R61) |
| Keypad streaming command set | Low-latency digit-by-digit commands & responses | Keypad feature postponed | Future (R56/R57) |

---
## 26. Out-of-Scope Suggestions (Deferred)
Previously proposed feature suggestions A‚ÄìJ explicitly deferred for v1; reinstate only via new requirement IDs if prioritized later.

---
## 12. Call Duration Timer
- Start at call_start event: `call_local_start_monotonic = time.monotonic()`.
- Update each second (Coordinator-managed task).
- If call_end arrives: commit final (prefer device durationMs else computed) then stop.
- If no end after 8h: auto-stop (safety watchdog).

---
## 13. Error Handling & Notifications
| Event/Error | User Visible Action |
|-------------|---------------------|
| system_error | Persistent notification + HA log error |
| maintenance_mode true | Persistent notification |
| shutdown (reason=reset_requested) | Log info; expect reconnect |
| queue overflow | Single warning per minute |
| schema mismatch | Warning once per boot |

---
## 14. Diagnostics Contents
- Device meta (id, host, port, version, last_seq, reboot_detected)
- Last 50 events (raw JSON)
- Stats & system metrics
- Config lists (quick dials, blocked, webhooks)
- Audio & DND config
- Queue sizes (event queue length, dropped count)
- Preset mapping summary
- Webhook stale entries list

---
## 15. Logging Policy
- Default DEBUG for first 300s or until stable state (5 consecutive successful WS pings or events) then downgrade INFO unless option `verbose_events` is set.
- Structured debug lines prefixed `[tsuryphone]` for easy filtering.

---
## 16. Test Plan (Key Cases)
| Area | Tests |
|------|-------|
| Discovery | Zeroconf create entry, duplicate prevention |
| Config Flow | Manual host fallback, schema warning displayed |
| WebSocket | Normal stream, reconnect, seq regression, overflow handling |
| Events | Each category updates correct entities & fires HA events |
| Call Lifecycle | start/end, missing start (synth), timer increments |
| Config Delta | Single + aggregated multi changes apply in order |
| Services | All success + error scenarios (invalid inputs) |
| Lists | Quick dial import/export round-trip; blocked list operations |
| Webhooks | Manual add, auto-create simulation (mock webhook registry) |
| Reboot | Snapshot refetch triggered, stale call cleared |
| Cache | Restore state on restart (sensor states present before WS connect) |
| Diagnostics | Output schema & includes required sections |
| Options Flow | Changing ring pattern (preset/custom), audio partial update |

Coverage Tools: pytest + pytest-asyncio + anyio; static: mypy; style: ruff.
